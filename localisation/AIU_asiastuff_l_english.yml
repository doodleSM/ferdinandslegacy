 aiu_japan.1.t:0 "Minseito Merges with Kenseikai and the Reformist Club"
 aiu_japan.1.d:0 "Seeking to triumph in the 1932 election by any means necessary, the Rikken Minseito has merged with the Kenseikai and Reformist parties following long discussions in which they offered substantial concessions to their new partners. It is clear that all three groups are desperate to overtake the ruling party."
 aiu_japan.1.a:0 "Will it be enough?"
 aiu_japan.2.t:0 "A New Taiwan Policy?"
 aiu_japan.2.d:0 "Following the rise of Prince Kan'in, Japan has adopted a much less tolerant policy towards Taiwan, attempting to colonise the island and force the Taiwanese to adopt Japanese customs. The Reformist lobby is keen to soften our touch in this area."
 aiu_japan.2.a:0 "Adopt a hands-off approach."
 aiu_japan.2.b:0 "Grant Taiwan its own Diet."
 aiu_japan.2.c:0 "We must continue to pressure the Taiwanese to adopt civilisation."
 aiu_japan.3.t:0 "The Nagasaki Conference"
 aiu_japan.3.d:0 "Representatives from both the Chinese Federation, which we have long supported, and the Anhui Clique, which has the favour of the west, have been invited to Nagasaki to discuss a potential coalition against the Beiyang government. Weakening the Beiyang would strengthen our influence in China and weaken that of Russia."
 aiu_japan.3.a:0 "Can they agree on a common cause?"
 aiu_japan.4.t:0 "The Nagasaki Conference"
 aiu_japan.4.d:0 "The Japanese have supported the Federation since Sun-Yat Sen agreed to numerous unpopular demands in exchange for Japan providing the support needed to bring a stop to the Beiyang Southern Expedition. They oppose Beiyang and its Russian patrons, and have summoned our representatives to Nagasaki for a conference to discuss a potential Federation/Anhui alliance against the Beiyang."
 aiu_japan.4.a:0 "We can put aside our differences."
 aiu_japan.4.b:0 "A temporary alliance is acceptable."
 aiu_japan.4.c:0 "We will not join forces with our rivals."
 aiu_japan.19.t:0 "The Conference comes to a close"
 aiu_japan.19.d:0 "After many hours of discussion, the debate seems to have run its course. We will now discover whether the Federation and Anhui Clique are willing to work together."
 aiu_japan.19.a:0 "They have both agreed!"
 aiu_japan.19.b:0 "Sadly, one party refused to take part."
 aiu_japan.19.c:0 "Neither can agree on anything. The conference has been a disaster."
 aiu_japan.5.t:0 "The Nagasaki Alliance"
 aiu_japan.5.d:0 "Following the Conference, we have made common cause with our former rivals and it is now time to prepare for war against the Beiyang!"
 aiu_japan.5.a:0 "To Beijing!"
 aiu_japan.6.t:0 "The Korean Question"
 aiu_japan.6.d:0 "In 1924, Japan was forced to release its hold on the Korean peninsula it had annexed in 1910 by the threat of Russian intervention in the Korean uprising.. This was a national humiliation, and the military-aligned governments ever since the disaster have made the return of Korea a core of our foreign policy. Will our new government bring an end to the tension?"
 aiu_japan.6.a:0 "We will offer to normalise relations."
 aiu_japan.6.b:0 "If they accept conditions of military access, we will agree to recognise their independence."
 aiu_japan.6.c:0 "They must become our subject nation."
 aiu_japan.7.t:0 "Japan offers to normalise relations"
 aiu_japan.7.d:0 "We have received unexpected news. Japan is willing to recognise our independence and normalise relations without conditions. This should finally end their hostility and embargo."
 aiu_japan.7.a:0 "These terms we can accept."
 aiu_japan.7.b:0 "This must be some kind of trick! Send them away."
 aiu_japan.8.t:0 "Korea refuses normalisation"
 aiu_japan.8.d:0 "Much to our surprise, the Koreans have refused our offer. They seem to want a war..."
 aiu_japan.8.a:0 "Then we will give them one."
 aiu_japan.8.b:0 "It's not worth it."
 aiu_japan.9.t:0 "Korea agrees to normalisation"
 aiu_japan.9.d:0 "We have ratified a pact of amity with the Koreans and formally renounced our claim on the peninsula. The threat of war between our nations seems to be over."
 aiu_japan.9.a:0 "They could never be like us anyway."
 aiu_japan.10.t:0 "Japan demands access in exchange for recognition"
 aiu_japan.10.d:0 "For the first time since 1924, a Japanese ship has arrived at port in our nation. The diplomats onboard bring an offer: they will end hostilities and recognise us in exchange for them being able to station troops and soldiers within our country."
 aiu_japan.10.a:0 "Fine, let's end this."
 aiu_japan.10.b:0 "Unacceptable demands."
 aiu_japan.11.t:0 "Korea agrees to grant us access"
 aiu_japan.11.d:0 "Hostilities between Japan and Korea have formally ended, as the Korean government signs a treaty granting Japanese troops and ships the right to be stationed within its borders."
 aiu_japan.11.a:0 "Good."
 aiu_japan.12.t:0 "Korea refuses us access"
 aiu_japan.12.d:0 "Faced with our offer, the Koreans have declined our terms. They will not grant us access rights on any conditions, they say."
 aiu_japan.12.a:0 "Then war it is."
 aiu_japan.12.b:0 "This is not worth a war."
 aiu_japan.13.t:0 "Japan demands our submission"
 aiu_japan.13.d:0 "The Japanese have sent an ultimatum with a long list of demands that amount to accepting them as our overlord, including signing away our independent foreign policy and transferring our military to their appointed officers. This is not what we hoped for when their new liberal government came to power."
 aiu_japan.13.a:0 "If this brings peace, then very well."
 aiu_japan.13.b:0 "We fought and died and our independence. We will not give it away."
 aiu_japan.14.t:0 "Korea submits to our ultimatum"
 aiu_japan.14.d:0 "Following their acceptance of our demands, we now have a great deal of control over our former colony of Korea, and they are beholden to our foreign policy and military hierarchy. The shame of our loss of Korea is perhaps somewhat mended."
 aiu_japan.14.a:0 "This is how it should be."
 aiu_japan.15.t:0 "Korea refuses our demands"
 aiu_japan.15.d:0 "The Koreans have rejected our ultimatum out of hand. They are unwillingly to hand over the independence they fought to gain from us. This is a major blow to our prestige, and must be punished..."
 aiu_japan.15.a:0 "We will take Korea by force."
 aiu_japan.15.b:0 "It can't be helped."
 aiu_japan.16.t:0 "Japan offers to buy Tsingtao"
 aiu_japan.16.d:0 "Our colony of Tsingtao has a strategic location on the Shandong peninsula, and is our main route into the Chinese markets. Japan has offered a hefty sum for us to transfer control of the colony to them, but are we willing to simply give it away?"
 aiu_japan.16.a:0 "Accept their offer."
 aiu_japan.16.b:0 "No, Tsingtao will remain ours."
 aiu_japan.17.t:0 "Germany agrees to sell Tsingtao"
 aiu_japan.17.d:0 "A formal ceremony has taken place in the colony of Tsingtao handing over the city to our new governor. It is now under our complete control."
 aiu_japan.17.a:0 "We have gained a useful port."
 aiu_japan.18.t:0 "Germany refuses to sell Tsingtao"
 aiu_japan.18.d:0 "Unfortunately, the response to our offer has been a decisive rejection, despite our diplomats offering to greatly increase the sum. It seems they are not willing to give up Tsingtao. Should we take this any further?"
 aiu_japan.18.a:0 "We will occupy it militarily until they see reason."
 aiu_japan.18.b:0 "Well, we tried."
 aiu_japan.20.t:0 "Japan demands governmental reorganisation"
 aiu_japan.20.d:0 "In addition to the long-running concessions we have made to Japan since 1917, the Japanese are now demanding terms that would make us nothing more than an imperial puppet. We would lose our control over our foreign policy and many other affairs. The ultimatum seems to be backed by force..."
 aiu_japan.20.a:0 "We will submit."
 aiu_japan.20.b:0 "Send these fools away."
 aiu_japan.21.t:0 "The Chinese Federation submits to reorganisation"
 aiu_japan.21.d:0 "With their acceptance of our demands, the Chinese Federation are now entirely subject to our foreign policy. We now have access to their vast resources and manpower and a major foothold on the Asian continent."
 aiu_japan.21.a:0 "A great day for the Empire."
 aiu_japan.22.t:0 "The Chinese Federation rejects reorganisation"
 aiu_japan.22.d:0 "Our demands have been categorically rejected by our Federation associates in China. They say they will not sign over their independence to us and have sought international condemnation of our 'aggression' and 'naked imperialism'."
 aiu_japan.22.a:0 "We will bring them to heel."
 aiu_japan.22.b:0 "There's nothing more we can do."
 aiu_japan.23.t:0 "The 1932 General Election"
 aiu_japan.23.d:0 "Japan goes to the polls as the ruling Seiyukai seek to hold their majority against the moderate parties. Rising world tensions bring extra urgency to this event; it could decide Japan's fate in the treacherous years to come."
 aiu_japan.23.a:0 "What will the voters decide?"
 aiu_japan.24.t:0 "Moderates Victorious!"
 aiu_japan.24.d:0 "After seventeen years of Seiyukai dominance in the House of Representatives, it seems that recent moderate efforts to unite against the ruling party and its military allies have won over the people of Japan in a slim victory. With no minor parties sufficiently large or willing to collaborate with the Seiyukai, the moderates are now finally in government."
 aiu_japan.24.a:0 "Interesting..."
 aiu_japan.25.t:0 "The ruling party is victorious!"
 aiu_japan.25.d:0 "The Ritten Seiyukai narrowly held onto their hold of the House of Representatives and have triumphed in the general election. Factions favouring imperial expansion and increasing militarism in Japanese society are very happy with the news."

 aiu_japan.26.t:0 "Japan demands our submission"
 aiu_japan.26.d:0 "Japan's imperial ambitions have worried our government for some time. These fears have proven warranted, as Japanese representatives have come before us with an ultimatum demanding that we sign away our independent foreign policy in exchange for Japanese protection and patronage. Their words are backed by military force- how should we respond?"
 aiu_japan.26.a:0 "Submit to their ultimatum."
 aiu_japan.26.b:0 "We will fight for our freedom."
 aiu_japan.27.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] accepts submission"
 aiu_japan.27.d:0 "The representatives of [From.GetNameDef] have wisely chosen to submit to our demands and are ready to accept the officials and soldiers we are sending to their nation without resistance."
 aiu_japan.27.a:0 "They will not regret it."
 aiu_japan.28.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] refuses to submit"
 aiu_japan.28.d:0 "Their stubborn officials have acted against their interest and the future of their nation by rejecting our demands and opposing our dream for Asia. This cannot go unanswered."
 aiu_japan.28.a:0 "We will drag them into the future."
 aiu_japan.28.b:0 "Leave them be."
 aiu_japan.29.t:0 "Japan Demands Indochina"
 aiu_japan.29.d:0 "Japanese forces are positioned ready to move in on our colony in Indochina, and they are demanding total access to our bases and facilities! If we agree to their request, we are effectively signing over control of Indochina to them. However, defending our distant colony against their ambitions would be a difficult task."
 aiu_japan.29.a:0 "We have no choice but to agree."
 aiu_japan.29.b:0 "Never!"
 aiu_japan.30.t:0 "The French Accept Our Demands"
 aiu_japan.30.d:0 "The French have agreed to our demands, and their bases and facilities in Indochina are at our complete disposal. They have effectively turned over full control of their colony to us."
 aiu_japan.30.a:0 "A wise move."
 aiu_japan.31.t:0 "The French Refuse Our Demands"
 aiu_japan.31.d:0 "The French have outrageously refused our demands! It seems that if we want Indochina, we'll have to take it by force!"
 aiu_japan.31.a:0 "A poor decision."
 aiu_japan.31.b:0 "We will take it anyway!"
 aiu_japan.32.t:0 "Japan offers us our former territories"
 aiu_japan.32.d:0 "Having secured French Indochina, the Japanese have begun making overtures to us. They offer us our former territories in Cambodia and Laos in exchange for a full alliance. However, if we accept, we will surely be wrapped up in their imperial schemes."
 aiu_japan.32.a:0 "We cannot thank them enough."
 aiu_japan.32.b:0 "No, we want no part in their dangerous ambitions."
 aiu_japan.33.t:0 "Siam accepts territorial transfer"
 aiu_japan.33.d:0 "The Siamese have gratefully accepted our offer of their former territories and already begun to reoccupy them. We are one step closer to removing the stain of European colonialism in Asia."
 aiu_japan.33.a:0 "We will write the future together."
 aiu_japan.34.t:0 "The Siamese reject our offer"
 aiu_japan.34.d:0 "The representatives of Siam have turned down our generous offer. We can only assume they are too afraid of the future we are building to be willing to tie themselves to us in an alliance. Their descendants will surely regret this."
 aiu_japan.34.a:0 "Ah well."
