 #events
 aiu_britain.0.t:0 "The UK in The Fallen Eagle"
 aiu_britain.0.d:0 "Current situation."
 aiu_britain.0.a:0 "Alright."
 aiu_britain.1.t:0 "Parliament debates intervention in Russia"
 aiu_britain.1.d:0 "The government has watched with concern as the situation in Russia has collapsed into civil war. While we have nominally been aligned with Russia since 1907, the relationship has been allowed to cool somewhat especially as Britain has moved further away from European politics. Different factions support sending a contingent to support the Emperor, only sending material aid, or simply expressing our support internationally."
 aiu_britain.1.a:0 "Send equipment and prepare a volunteer force."
 aiu_britain.1.b:0 "Some old equipment should be enough."
 aiu_britain.1.c:0 "Better to restrict our support to verbal form."
 aiu_britain.2.t:0 "Britain sends aid"
 aiu_britain.2.d:0 "The British have decided to send several ships with military equipment to us, and are currently preparing some volunteer units to help us out in our fight against the enemies of our state."
 aiu_britain.2.a:0 "We knew they were a friend of ours."
 aiu_britain.3.t:0 "Britain sends aid"
 aiu_britain.3.d:0 "We have received a consignment of military equipment from the British to support our war effort. Perhaps this will help us resolve our arms shortage."
 aiu_britain.3.a:0 "The help is appreciated."
 aiu_britain.4.t:0 "Britain speaks up in support of us"
 aiu_britain.4.d:0 "The British issued a statement today condemning both the August Revolution and Bolshevik uprisings, and recognising us as the legitimate government of Russia. However, this has not been accompanied by any military aid at all, which we have been requesting."
 aiu_britain.4.a:0 "Is that it?"
 aiu_britain.5.t:0 "British volunteers arrive"
 aiu_britain.5.d:0 "A ship entered harbour today from Great Britain, carrying the troops the British promised to sent to support us in the civil war."
 aiu_britain.5.a:0 "We receive our brothers in arms."
 RUS_british_volunteer_divisions_tt:0 "Two British volunteer divisions have arrived to help us."
 aiu_britain.6.t:0 "British volunteers go home"
 aiu_britain.6.d:0 "Today saw the departure of the British volunteer divisions that arrived to assist us in the war effort. They fought hard alongside us, and we may miss their assistance."
 aiu_britain.6.a:0 "A heartfelt farewell."
 aiu_britain.7.t:0 "Our volunteers arrive home"
 aiu_britain.7.d:0 "After their service in Russia, the volunteer divisions we sent have finally come home. They bring back with them experience in modern warfare, which seems to have changed indeed..."
 aiu_britain.7.a:0 "Their knowledge will help us prepare."
 aiu_britain.8.t:0 "Britain recognises our government"
 aiu_britain.8.d:0 "Though the British initially sided with the Empire in the civil war, their position has now changed. They have issued a statement recognising us as the new government of Russia and cautiously re-opening economic and diplomatic relations. Perhaps they recognise that we are a force for democracy in a dangerous world."
 aiu_britain.8.a:0 "Good news."
 aiu_britain.9.t:0 "Britain proposes a renewal of our defensive pact"
 aiu_britain.9.d:0 "The past few decades saw Britain gradually distancing itself from its interests and relations on the continent, but the current situation appears to have changed their stance. They have now come to offer as a new and even more extensive defensive agreement in case of attack on either one of our nations."
 aiu_britain.9.a:0 "We would be glad to renew our alliance."
 aiu_britain.9.b:0 "We no longer need them."
 aiu_britain.10.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] agrees to renew our alliance"
 aiu_britain.10.d:0 "The signing of our new, expanded defensive agreement with [From.GetNameDef] took place today and was followed by raptured applause from both sides. The restoration of our old agreement is hopefully a step towards restoring stability and order in Europe."
 aiu_britain.10.a:0 "Three cheers for our old [From.GetAdjective] friends!"
 aiu_britain.11.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] rejects our alliance offer"
 aiu_britain.11.d:0 "It seems we have waited too long before attempting to repair our ties with [From.GetNameDef]. Responding to our offer, they claimed it was no longer in their country's interest to continue to commit our nations to each other in this way."
 aiu_britain.11.a:0 "A shame."
 aiu_britain.12.t:0 "Britain installs a full embargo"
 aiu_britain.12.d:0 "Trade with Britain has come to a complete halt following a declaration by their government denouncing our government and calling on other nations to follow suit. This is a painful change for our nation, having previously traded extensively with the British. But do we really need their capitalist fingers in the new nation we are building?"
 aiu_britain.12.a:0 "They cannot slow the Revolution!"
 aiu_britain.13.t:0 "Britain guarantees our independence"
 aiu_britain.13.d:0 "Responding to the threat of Bolshevik aggression, the British have given a firm declaration to protect our sovereignty against the Reds, whether they should strike against us through force or subversion."
 aiu_britain.13.a:0 "The Reds are being isolated."
 aiu_britain.14.t:0 "Britain seeks an Anti-Bolshevik Pact"
 aiu_britain.14.d:0 "Calling upon on our old ties represented by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and our common enemy in Bolshevik Russia, the British have approached us with an agreement that would commit both our nations to joining in any war against the Red Menace. Our assistance would certainly force the Russians to divide their forces and perhaps we might have our second chance to humble our nemesis, as well as halt their so-called Revolution..."
 aiu_britain.14.a:0 "A wise initiative."
 aiu_britain.14.b:0 "No, we cannot join right now."
 aiu_britain.15.t:0 "Japan accepts our Anti-Bolshevik Pact"
 aiu_britain.15.d:0 "Our old friend Japan has agreed to join in our pact against the Red Menace. In any war against Bolshevik Russia, our nations are now committed to join in support of each other."
 aiu_britain.15.a:0 "Together we will end the Red Menace."
 aiu_britain.16.t:0 "Japan rejects the Anti-Bolshevik Pact"
 aiu_britain.16.d:0 "Unfortunately, Japan has refused to commit to an Anti-Bolshevik Pact as we have requested. We will not be able to call them to aid us in a war against the Reds."
 aiu_britain.16.a:0 "Disappointing."
 aiu_britain.17.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] calls us to arms"
 aiu_britain.17.d:0 "Our common Bolshevik enemy is currently at war with [From.GetNameDef], who requests our assistance as per the Anti-Bolshevik Pact we joined promising to support each other in any such war."
 aiu_britain.17.a:0 "We will join without hesitation."
 aiu_britain.17.b:0 "The Pact was a mistake."
 aiu_britain.18.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] dishonours our call to arms"
 aiu_britain.18.d:0 "Betrayal! Despite the terms of our agreement to come to each other's aid in case of any war with the Reds, the government of [From.GetNameDef] has treacherously reneged on the agreement."
 aiu_britain.18.a:0 "Unforgivable!"
 aiu_britain.19.t:0 "Britain expands its sphere of influence in our country"
 aiu_britain.19.d:0 "As per the Anglo-Russian Entente, Persia was decided to spheres of economic and political dominance by Britain and Russia. The collapse of Russian power has caused Britain to expand to fill the power vacuum, sending troops deep into the north of our country."
 aiu_britain.19.a:0 "We had a little respite..."
 aiu_britain.20.t:0 "Britain offers to protect the Baku oil fields"
 aiu_britain.20.d:0 "The great importance of the oil fields of Baku make them a major strategic asset. The British have sent us an offer guaranteeing our protection in exchange for preferential access to its production and certain other concessions."
 aiu_britain.20.a:0 "It would be a great help."
 aiu_britain.20.b:0 "Reject their offer."
 aiu_britain.21.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] accepts our offer"
 aiu_britain.21.d:0 "After a short period of consideration, the government of [From.GetNameDef] has agreed to our offer, and made several concessions to us. In exchange, we will protect them from any aggressor as we promised."
 aiu_britain.21.a:0 "We will dispatch a force at once.."
 aiu_britain.22.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] declines our offer"
 aiu_britain.22.d:0 "Despite the clear vulnerability of the Baku oil fields, the government of [From.GetNameDef] has declined our offer of protection. They will have to defend the oil without us."
 aiu_britain.22.a:0 "Short-sighted."
 aiu_britain.23.t:0 "The Tariff issue"
 aiu_britain.23.d:0 "Tariffs have been a key issue in British politics for a very long time. Our party, traditionally very much in favour, has recently seen a faction develop supporting an approach based on free trade. The issue has come to a head and we must choose our way forward."
 aiu_britain.23.a:0 "We cannot do without tariffs on steel and coal."
 aiu_britain.23.b:0 "Free trade will always win out."
 aiu_britain.24.t:0 "Britain shelters the Romanovs"
 aiu_britain.24.d:0 "Following the escape of the Romanovs from Russia, they have managed to make their way to the British Isles where the government and monarchy have granted them refuge. They have refused our demands to send over members of the family for trial, despite their infamous crimes against the Russian people."
 aiu_britain.24.a:0 "They are shielding war criminals from justice."
 aiu_britain.25.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] calls us to arms"
 aiu_britain.25.d:0 "Our common Bolshevik enemy is currently at war with [From.GetNameDef], who requests our assistance as per the Anti-Bolshevik Pact we joined promising to support each other in any such war."
 aiu_britain.25.a:0 "We will join without hesitation."
 aiu_britain.25.b:0 "The Pact was a mistake."
 aiu_britain.26.t:0 "The British send us support"
 aiu_britain.26.d:0 "A consignment of British equipment has arrived on our shores, along with a number of British advisors. They have offered to help train our officers and soldiers to fight the red threat."
 aiu_britain.26.a:0 "The help is appreciated."
