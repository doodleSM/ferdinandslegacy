 aiu_rsp.1.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] is preparing to attack us!"
 aiu_rsp.1.d:0 "Refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of our government, the warmongers in [From.GetNameDef] are preparing to march into our land and take away our hard-earned and long-deserved independence. We must stand to arms!"
 aiu_rsp.1.a:0 "We will weather this tide!"
 aiu_blu.1.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] offers us SSR status"
 aiu_blu.1.d:0 "Representatives from [From.GetNameDef] have presented us with a plan that would make us a semi-autonomous soviet socialist republic, maintaining some domestic control but handing over much of our military and foreign policy apparatus to their leadership. They claim that this would be a step forward for socialist unity and strengthen both our nations, but some in our government are unconvinced."
 aiu_blu.1.a:0 "The Left must unite."
 aiu_blu.1.b:0 "We cannot sign away our freedom."
 aiu_blu.2.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] accepts SSR status"
 aiu_blu.2.d:0 "After discussing our proposal, the government of [From.GetNameDef] has agreed to our plan making them a semi-autonomous SSR under our unified leadership. Their military and foreign policy are now under our majority control."
 aiu_blu.2.a:0 "We stand together."
 aiu_blu.3.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] rejects SSR status"
 aiu_blu.3.d:0 "When our representatives set down our proposal making [From.GetNameDef] a semi-autonomous SSR of our Union, they were met with a flat rejection of our terms. This has the potential to drive a rift between our previously ideologically close governments. How should we respond?"
 aiu_blu.3.a:0 "They will come around eventually."
 aiu_blu.3.b:0 "They are obviously counter-revolutionary bourgeois sympathisers. It's time for us to step in."
 aiu_blu.4.t:0 "The Crimean Referendum of [GetYear]"
 aiu_blu.4.d:0 "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has begun to pressure us to hold a referendum on joining their country as an integral state. A substantial proportion of our population sympathises with this sentiment, and our government has agreed such a plebiscite in order to put the matter to rest. We have counted the votes, but whether we act on them is up to us."
 aiu_blu.4.a:0 "Our countries should be one."
 aiu_blu.4.b:0 "No, we will maintain our independence."
 aiu_blu.5.t:0 "Crimea agrees to annexation"
 aiu_blu.5.d:0 "Following a plebiscite in their country, Crimea has decided to accept our call for unity and joined our country."
 aiu_blu.5.a:0 "Welcome home!"
 aiu_blu.6.t:0 "Crimea rejects annexation"
 aiu_blu.6.d:0 "After holding a plebiscite, the Crimean government has sent word to us that they cannot accept our call for merging our countries. They will retain their independence unless we act drastically."
 aiu_blu.6.a:0 "We will accept this result, for now."
 aiu_blu.6.b:0 "Clearly rigged! We must liberate them!"
 aiu_blu.7.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] is violating our sovereignty"
 aiu_blu.7.d:0 "For the past few days, soldiers from [From.GetNameDef] have been violating our borders, harassing our soldiers, and causing all sorts of problems for our frontier guardsmen. However, they have not done anything we are able to use to invoke international condemnation. Some of our leadership believe that they are attempting to provoke an incident that would give them deniability while letting them go to war with us."
 aiu_blu.7.a:0 "This behaviour must be punished!"
 aiu_blu.7.b:0 "We will not walk into a trap."
 aiu_blu.8.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] wants us to secure Central Asia"
 aiu_blu.8.d:0 "In recent secret meetings, representatives from [From.GetNameDef] have offered us material and diplomat support to begin an all-out campaign to secure Central Asia. If we agree, they will provide us with plenty of men and material."
 aiu_blu.8.a:0 "What are we waiting for?"
 aiu_blu.8.b:0 "No, we are not ready for this."
