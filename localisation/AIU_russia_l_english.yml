 aiu_rsp.1.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] is preparing to attack us!"
 aiu_rsp.1.d:0 "Refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of our government, the warmongers in [From.GetNameDef] are preparing to march into our land and take away our hard-earned and long-deserved independence. We must stand to arms!"
 aiu_rsp.1.a:0 "We will weather this tide!"
 aiu_blu.1.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] offers us SSR status"
 aiu_blu.1.d:0 "Representatives from [From.GetNameDef] have presented us with a plan that would make us a semi-autonomous soviet socialist republic, maintaining some domestic control but handing over much of our military and foreign policy apparatus to their leadership. They claim that this would be a step forward for socialist unity and strengthen both our nations, but some in our government are unconvinced."
 aiu_blu.1.a:0 "The Left must unite."
 aiu_blu.1.b:0 "We cannot sign away our freedom."
 aiu_blu.2.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] accepts SSR status"
 aiu_blu.2.d:0 "After discussing our proposal, the government of [From.GetNameDef] has agreed to our plan making them a semi-autonomous SSR under our unified leadership. Their military and foreign policy are now under our majority control."
 aiu_blu.2.a:0 "We stand together."
 aiu_blu.3.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] rejects SSR status"
 aiu_blu.3.d:0 "When our representatives set down our proposal making [From.GetNameDef] a semi-autonomous SSR of our Union, they were met with a flat rejection of our terms. This has the potential to drive a rift between our previously ideologically close governments. How should we respond?"
 aiu_blu.3.a:0 "They will come around eventually."
 aiu_blu.3.b:0 "They are obviously counter-revolutionary bourgeois sympathisers. It's time for us to step in."
 aiu_blu.4.t:0 "The Crimean Referendum of [GetYear]"
 aiu_blu.4.d:0 "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has begun to pressure us to hold a referendum on joining their country as an integral state. A substantial proportion of our population sympathises with this sentiment, and our government has agreed such a plebiscite in order to put the matter to rest. We have counted the votes, but whether we act on them is up to us."
 aiu_blu.4.a:0 "Our countries should be one."
 aiu_blu.4.b:0 "No, we will maintain our independence."
 aiu_blu.5.t:0 "Crimea agrees to annexation"
 aiu_blu.5.d:0 "Following a plebiscite in their country, Crimea has decided to accept our call for unity and joined our country."
 aiu_blu.5.a:0 "Welcome home!"
 aiu_blu.6.t:0 "Crimea rejects annexation"
 aiu_blu.6.d:0 "After holding a plebiscite, the Crimean government has sent word to us that they cannot accept our call for merging our countries. They will retain their independence unless we act drastically."
 aiu_blu.6.a:0 "We will accept this result, for now."
 aiu_blu.6.b:0 "Clearly rigged! We must liberate them!"
 aiu_blu.7.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] is violating our sovereignty"
 aiu_blu.7.d:0 "For the past few days, soldiers from [From.GetNameDef] have been violating our borders, harassing our soldiers, and causing all sorts of problems for our frontier guardsmen. However, they have not done anything we are able to use to invoke international condemnation. Some of our leadership believe that they are attempting to provoke an incident that would give them deniability while letting them go to war with us."
 aiu_blu.7.a:0 "This behaviour must be punished!"
 aiu_blu.7.b:0 "We will not walk into a trap."
 aiu_blu.8.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] wants us to secure Central Asia"
 aiu_blu.8.d:0 "In recent secret meetings, representatives from [From.GetNameDef] have offered us material and diplomat support to begin an all-out campaign to secure Central Asia. If we agree, they will provide us with plenty of men and material."
 aiu_blu.8.a:0 "What are we waiting for?"
 aiu_blu.8.b:0 "No, we are not ready for this."
 aiu_blu.9.t:0 "Russia is Ours!"
 aiu_blu.9.d:0 "Through courage and steel, we have retaken Russia from our enemies and rescued its people from their clutches. However, many have died, both military and civilian, and large swathes of the country lie in ruins. It will take time to restore the land to its former productivity."
 aiu_blu.9.a:0 "Our Motherland can now stand proud once more."
 aiu_cau.1.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] offers peace"
 aiu_cau.1.d:0 "After taking the territories they aimed to take in their war against us, the leaders of [From.GetNameDef] have sent word that they are willing to negotiate a peace involving the transfer of these territories."
 aiu_cau.1.a:0 "We have no choice."
 aiu_cau.1.b:0 "Fight until the last."
 aiu_cau.2.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] accepts peace"
 aiu_cau.2.d:0 "We have been able to negotiate a peace with [From.GetNameDef] including the transfer of our contested territories. This is a great victory for our nation and furthers our interests abroad."
 aiu_cau.2.a:0 "These peoples are now safe with us."
 aiu_cau.3.t:0 "Peace terms rejected!"
 aiu_cau.3.d:0 "It seems that the leaders of [From.GetNameDef] have chosen to fight to the very end. We will not be able to take the territories we need without completely toppling their government."
 aiu_cau.3.a:0 "So be it."
 aiu_cau.4.t:0 "Independence Crisis!"
 aiu_cau.4.d:0 "Our young state contains both the lands of the Georgians and the Azerbaijanis within its borders. Many of the latter resent our current government, seeing it as too controlled by Georgians at the price of looking after its Azerbaijanis, and preventing the self-determination of a free Azerbaijani state. We have been forced to call a referendum to see if the issue can be settled."
 aiu_cau.4.a:0 "Hold a fair referendum."
 aiu_cau.4.b:0 "Lean on the Soviets to make sure we win."
 aiu_cau.5.t:0 "Independence Referendum - Federation Maintained"
 aiu_cau.5.d:0 "To the surprise of many, the referendum in Azerbaijan resulted in a win for the side supporting the federation. The nation rides high on unification sentiment and the newspapers glowingly emphasise that together, we can find a safe and solid place in the world."
 aiu_cau.5.a:0 "Georgians and Azerbaijanis shall always be brothers and sisters!"
 aiu_cau.6.t:0 "Independence Referendum - Azerbaijan votes to Leave"
 aiu_cau.6.d:0 "There is an atmosphere of sadness in the Sejm as the result of the independence referendum is reported. It seems that the Transcaucasian Federation is over, and the two nations of Georgia and Azerbaijan will go their separate ways... unless we were to intervene and suppress this danger to both our nations..."
 aiu_cau.6.a:0 "It is their right to make their own way in the world."
 aiu_cau.6.b:0 "Send in the troops."
 aiu_cau.7.t:0 "Independence Referendum - The Soviets save the Federation"
 aiu_cau.7.d:0 "While the result of the referendum was in favour of continued federation as we desired, it has become common knowledge that this was mainly the result of the power of the Soviets, who seem to be gaining confidence and will to use their power in order to extend an agenda somewhat different to ours- no doubt this has been inflamed by marxist refugees from the Russian Civil War."
 aiu_cau.7.a:0 "We will have to keep an eye on them..."
 aiu_cau.8.t:0 "A Monarch!"
 aiu_cau.8.d:0 "Until we were forced to submit to Russia to save our nation, our lands have always been a kingdom of their own. Popular fondness for the House of Bagrationi is still high, but unfortunately its last direct descendant is resting in peace. Two other branches have survived from which we could choose a monarch, or alternatively we could invite a foreign prince to strengthen our ties with that nation. Who should take our throne?"
 aiu_cau.8.a:0 "The obvious choice, George Bagration-Mukhraneli."
 CAU_george_bagrationi_leader:0 "George Bagration-Mukhraneli is monarch"
 aiu_cau.8.b:0 "The head of the other branch, the military man Konstantin Bagration-Gruzinsky."
 CAU_konstantin_bagrationi_leader:0 "Konstantin Bagration-Gruzinsky is monarch"
 aiu_cau.8.c:0 "We need someone beloved by the people. Crown a queen, Leonida Bagration-Mukhraneli."
 CAU_leonida_bagrationi_leader:0 "Leonida Bagration-Mukhraneli is monarch"
 aiu_cau.8.e:0 "How about a foreign prince?."
 aiu_cau.8.h:0 "We can strengthen our ties to Russia by inviting a Romanov prince."
 CAU_romanov_prince_leader:0 "A Romanov is monarch"
 aiu_cau.8.f:0 "A German prince will strengthen the ties between our countries."
 CAU_german_prince_leader:0 "A Prussian prince is monarch"
 aiu_cau.8.g:0 "A prince of the British line of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha will link us to Britain."
 CAU_british_prince_leader:0 "A British prince is monarch"
 aiu_cau.9.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] proposes a defensive alliance"
 aiu_cau.9.d:0 "Our nation is under great threat from enemies abroad, eager to seize what they can from themselves. The government of [From.GetNameDef] has proposed a defensive alliance to us, committing our nations to join in the defence if either of our countries is attacked."
 aiu_cau.9.a:0 "We will be friends and brothers."
 aiu_cau.9.b:0 "No, we cannot tie ourselves to them."
 aiu_cau.10.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] agrees to a defensive alliance"
 aiu_cau.10.d:0 "We have received a strong positive response to our proposal, and our representatives are currently signing a treaty guaranteeing the mutual defense of our two nations in case of attack. This is a step towards a safer world."
 aiu_cau.10.a:0 "We knew we had friends in [From.GetNameDef]."
 aiu_cau.11.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] rejects our defensive pact proposal"
 aiu_cau.11.d:0 "Our offer to commit to a mutual defensive pact has been rejected by the government of [From.GetNameDef]. Neither of our nations will be committed to defend the other in case a third party declares war."
 aiu_cau.11.a:0 "A shame."
 aiu_cau.12.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] requests assistance in protecting the Baku Oil Fields"
 aiu_cau.12.d:0 "There was a time early in this century when the oil fields of Baku produced over half the world's oil. Recent discoveries have reduced this extreme dominance, but nevertheless the quantity and quality of its Caspian oil makes it of enormous strategic importance. [From.GetNameDefCap] have come to us to request assistance in protecting these vital fields and helping restore their output to the benefit of all nations."
 aiu_cau.12.a:0 "We will safeguard the precious oil."
 aiu_cau.12.b:0 "We cannot afford to do that."
 aiu_cau.13.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] agrees to support Baku oil operations"
 aiu_cau.13.d:0 "Our overtures to [From.GetNameDef] met with success, and their government has declared that they will help us protect and transport the oil produced by the Baku fields."
 aiu_cau.13.a:0 "They will not regret this."
 aiu_cau.14.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] refuses to safeguard the Baku oil"
 aiu_cau.14.d:0 "To our dismay, we have received a refusal from the government of [From.GetNameDef], who claim they cannot spare the forces to assist us in maintaining the oil fields."
 aiu_cau.14.a:0 "They have passed up on a wonderful opportunity."
 aiu_cau.15.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] declares support for our side in the Civil War"
 aiu_cau.15.d:0 "We have just received a declaration of support from the government in [From.GetNameDef], who have stated that they support our side and plan to help us achieve victory and restore order to Russia. However, recognising their government would legitimise it, should we wish to retake that territory in the future."
 aiu_cau.15.a:0 "Welcome to the right side."
 aiu_cau.15.b:0 "'Government'? Don't make me laugh."
 aiu_cau.16.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] accepts our declaration of support"
 aiu_cau.16.d:0 "Our chosen side in Russia, [From.GetNameDef], has gratefully accepted our declaration and we have released a common statement expressing our desire for both our nations to restore order and a better way forwards to the lands of Russia."
 aiu_cau.16.a:0 "Excellent."
 aiu_cau.17.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] rejects our support"
 aiu_cau.17.d:0 "In a move unbefitting of any nation, the representatives of [From.GetNameDef] have rejected our officials and refused our declaration of support. This is sure to shake our faith in the righteousness of their cause, and perhaps it will make us look elsewhere..."
 aiu_cau.17.a:0 "They have acted unwisely."
 aiu_cau.18.t:0 "The Future of Armenia"
 aiu_cau.18.d:0 "The territories of Armenia were seized from our Empire piece by piece by the Russian Empire, most recently in the war which broke out in 1914. The unified government claiming to control Western and Eastern Armenia should not exist, and it seems that the government of [From.GetNameDef] agrees. They have proposed that we jointly invade Armenia and divide the nation between ourselves, restoring some of our territory. However, this will mean that some of our claims will enter their hands."
 aiu_cau.18.a:0 "Very well, let's partition Armenia."
 aiu_cau.18.b:0 "They should be part of our Empire too..."
 aiu_cau.19.t:0 "Ottoman approval"
 aiu_cau.19.d:0 "Our secret offer has been approved by the Ottoman leadership. We will divide Armenia between ourselves."
 aiu_cau.19.a:0 "Armenia does not have long left, now."
 aiu_cau.20.t:0 "The Ottomans reject our plan"
 aiu_cau.20.d:0 "After we presented our plan in a secret meeting, we were met with a cold response. Soon after, we were informed that they have no interest in our plan and if we wish to take our lands in Armenia, we will have to do it without them."
 aiu_cau.20.a:0 "Unhelpful."
 aiu_cau.21.t:0 "Negotiations with Armenia"
 aiu_cau.21.d:0 "With the birth of our nations, we have been confronted with the messy issue of our borders with Armenia. Our peoples cannot be neatly divided into simple shapes, but many exclaves and isolated communities are claimed by one side or the other. If we seek to come to a final agreement with Armenia on our future borders, we will have to decide how much we will demand at the table."
 aiu_cau.21.a:0 "Only Lori is vital."
 aiu_cau.21.b:0 "Both Lori and Artvin are integral parts of our nation."
 aiu_cau.21.c:0 "Lori and Artvin are necessary, but so is Karabakh."
 aiu_cau.21.e:0 "We cannot go without Lori, Artvin, Karabakh or Nakhchivan."
 aiu_cau.22.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] seeks to purchase Lori"
 aiu_cau.22.d:0 "The messy and often divisive borders between us and [From.GetNameDef] leave much to be desired, separating peoples from their homelands through quirks of history and geography. One issue is that of the province of Lori, which has a large Georgian population. The government of [From.GetNameDef] is offering a sum in exchange for the transfer of the territory to them."
 aiu_cau.22.a:0 "That is acceptable."
 aiu_cau.22.b:0 "An outrageous offer."
 aiu_cau.23.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] seeks to purchase Lori and Ardvin"
 aiu_cau.23.d:0 "The messy and often divisive borders between us and [From.GetNameDef] leave much to be desired, separating peoples from their homelands through quirks of history and geography. One issue is that of the provinces of Lori and Artvin, which have large Georgian populations. The government of [From.GetNameDef] is offering a large sum in exchange for the transfer of these territories."
 aiu_cau.23.a:0 "Very well."
 aiu_cau.23.b:0 "They will not take our lands."
 aiu_cau.24.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] seeks to purchase Lori, Artvin and Karabakh"
 aiu_cau.24.d:0 "The messy and often divisive borders between us and [From.GetNameDef] leave much to be desired, separating peoples from their homelands through quirks of history and geography. The provinces of Lori, Artvin and Karabakh contain large populations of peoples the government of [From.GetNameDef] claims to represent, and as such they have offered a great sum in exchange for the transfer of these lands to them."
 aiu_cau.24.a:0 "This could bring lasting peace."
 aiu_cau.24.b:0 "What an absurd request."
 aiu_cau.25.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] seeks to purchase Lori"
 aiu_cau.25.d:0 "The messy and often divisive borders between us and [From.GetNameDef] leave much to be desired, separating peoples from their homelands through quirks of history and geography. The government of [From.GetNameDef] has a radical plan to resolve our border issues with them. They are offering a huge sum in exchange for the transfer not only of their bordering territories of Lori, Artvin and Karabakh, but also the Azeribaijani-dominated exclave of Nakhchivan. Can we accept such an offer?"
 aiu_cau.25.a:0 "If this is what it takes to resolve the matter."
 aiu_cau.25.b:0 "We will never give these lands up."
 aiu_cau.26.t:0 "Success in Negotiations"
 aiu_cau.26.d:0 "Great cheer has come to the nation today as we have successfully acquired the territories we requested without a single bullet shot or drop of blood spilt. Our scattered peoples are one step closer to union under our flag."
 aiu_cau.26.a:0 "A great day for all our peoples."
 aiu_cau.27.t:0 "Negotiations break down"
 aiu_cau.27.d:0 "Our attempt to bring peace to the Caucasus seems to have done anything but. Our failed negotiations have stoked fresh resentment between us and the Armenians, and our attempt to acquire our peoples' lands has been firmly denied."
 aiu_cau.27.a:0 "This was a mistake."
 aiu_cau.28.t:0 "An invitation to a coalition"
 aiu_cau.28.d:0 "The foreign policy of [From.GetNameDef] has recently developed into a strategy to isolate and undermine the influence of the Ottoman Empire, one-time hegemon of the Near and Middle East. Recognising our ancient enmity with their aggressive ambitions, the leaders of [From.GetNameDef] have invited us to a developing coalition meant to end the Ottoman threat to their neighbours."
 aiu_cau.28.a:0 "Their era ended long ago."
 aiu_cau.28.b:0 "Not for us, thank you."
 aiu_cau.29.t:0 "The Coalition Grows"
 aiu_cau.29.d:0 "Our overtures to [From.GetNameDef] have been successful, and they have signed a treaty promising membership in our anti-Ottoman coalition. Together, how can the Ottomans hope to succeed against us?"
 aiu_cau.29.a:0 "We will put the sick man to bed."
 aiu_cau.30.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] refuses to join our coalition"
 aiu_cau.30.d:0 "Unfortunately, we have been turned down by [From.GetNameDef] in our mission to include them in our coalition. We will have to do without them when the time comes."
 aiu_cau.30.a:0 "Oh well."
 aiu_cau.31.t:0 "From.GetNameDef] has joined a coalition against us!"
 aiu_cau.31.d:0 "A conspiracy against us is growing on our borders, as a new nation has signed a treaty aimed at undermining our country and power. This is an unacceptable act of aggression against us."
 aiu_cau.31.a:0 "They will not scare us into submission."
 aiu_cau.32.t:0 "Increased Kurdish Agitation"
 aiu_cau.32.d:0 "Anti-Ottoman activities among our Kurdish vilayets have increased sharply in recent days. This agitation is perhaps a warning of something larger to come, but for now we can only suspect that a foreign power is meddling within our borders and inciting our subjects against us."
 aiu_cau.32.a:0 "I hope they are not planning to betray us..."
 aiu_cau.33.t:0 "Rumblings in Syria"
 aiu_cau.33.d:0 "A growing republican movement in Syria has long been advocating for self-determination and national liberation, but the volume of their voices has increased recently. Evidently, something is making them feel more able to speak out- could some power beyond our borders be supporting them?"
 aiu_cau.33.a:0 "They will never dare rise up against us."
 aiu_cau.34.t:0 "The Coalition Goes to War"
 aiu_cau.34.d:0 "The long-planned war with the Ottoman menace has finally arrived. Our immediate assistance against our great enemy is now called for."
 aiu_cau.34.a:0 "To arms!"
 aiu_cau.34.b:0 "We cannot spare the men."
 aiu_cau.35.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] declines the call"
 aiu_cau.35.d:0 "Despite their membership in the coalition and previous firm commitments, the arrival of the war itself appears to have been too much for [From.GetNameDef], who is not deploying their forces as arranged. This is an unconscionable disgrace."
 aiu_cau.35.a:0 "What are they thinking?"
 aiu_cau.36.t:0 "A Foreign Monarch?"
 aiu_cau.36.d:0 "We could invite a monarch from a foreign royal family to take the throne."
 aiu_cau.36.a:0 "We can strengthen our ties to Russia by inviting a Romanov prince."
 CAU_romanov_prince_leader:0 "A Romanov is monarch"
 aiu_cau.36.b:0 "A German prince will strengthen the ties between our countries."
 CAU_german_prince_leader:0 "A Prussian prince is monarch"
 aiu_cau.36.c:0 "A prince of the British line of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha will link us to Britain."
 CAU_british_prince_leader:0 "A British prince is monarch"
