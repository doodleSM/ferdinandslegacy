aiu_rus.2.d:0 "Whilst the Generals did suspect something, no one could expect that the Tsar would personally take control of the Military! Citing the current generals in command as 'incompetent', he has taken full control of the Army as Supreme Commander.\nWhilst the Actual soldiers have no quarrel with this, the Generals in the Army, Especially Wrangel and Denikin have seen this as an open confrontation of them.."
aiu_rus.2.a:0 "This could Cause Trouble..."
aiu_rus.3.t:0 "Wrangel and Denikin Meet"
aiu_rus.3.d:0 "Two of the most Prominent Generals in our Army, Baron Pyotr Wrangel and General Denikin, have met under suspicious circumstances. The two spent the whole night, seen in fervent discussions along with a few other Generals until Late Night. Whilst nothing is certain, there is a possibility that they could be up to something..."
aiu_rus.3.a:0 "How Queer..."
aiu_rus.4.t:0 "Riots in the Cities"
aiu_rus.4.d:0 "The Situation in our country has been growing quite dire, with Democratic riots popping up in one of our main cities. The situation there is getting quite dangerous, slowing down work in the area, as well as causing more military to be diverted there.\n We should act according to the Tsars' will."
aiu_rus.4.a:0 "Send the Military in!"

aiu_rus.5.t:0 "Military Sent In"
aiu_rus.5.d:0 "The Military has arrived in the City, causing some of the Riots to cease. However, the Civilians are still quite restless, roused up by the democratic elements in the City. The General in charge however is quite restless, so God Knows what could happen"

aiu_rus.6.t:0 "Civilians Shot"
aiu_rus.6.d:0 "Dire News my Tsar!\n As suspected, the General in charge of the Military force in the city seems to have lost his Nerve! During a Protest which turned sour fast, the man in Charge lost his temper and ordered the Military stationed to push the Civilians back. After a small fight broke out between some more Radical Elements, the General order the ones resiting to be fired warning shots at. This however, ended in a Massacare with over 20 Civlians being killed and many more wounded"
aiu_rus.6.a:0 "Detain that Man!"

aiu_rus.8.t:0 "The Generals demand Release of Detained General"
aiu_rus.8.d:0 "Even though the Mongrel deserved it, but it seems that our most recent Decision to Imprison the General has resulted in outright opposition from the Generals! Wrangel and Denikin are advocating for the General, claiming that he was only doing his job in Protecting the army from the Agressive locals. What will be our response?"
aiu_rus.8.a:0 "The Tsar stands by his Decision"
aiu_rus.8.b:0 "The Tsar caves in."
aiu_rus.7.t:0 "The General is Detained"
aiu_rus.7.d:0 "The General responsible for the Massacre has been swiftly dealt with, and has put put under arrest by the Tsar's personal guards. Whilst the Civilians seem relieved by this decisions, this has only angered the Military more, who see the Tsar as Unjust and will most likely demand that the General be released from custody... "
aiu_rus.7.a:0 "This does not Bode Well."
aiu_rus.9.t:0 "The Tsar Denies"
aiu_rus.9.d:0 "Staying true true to his statement, the Tsar has declared that he will not step down from his decision, and that the General will remain in custody until his fate has been decided. This seems to have brought the Situation to a Boiling point, with General Denikin openly opposing the Tsar in a statement earlier today. God himself knows what could happen"
aiu_rus.9.a:0 "That Denikin always was a Hothead"
aiu_rus.10.t:0 "Military Plans Coup"
aiu_rus.10.d:0 "The situation has definetely reached boiling point.\n Eariler today, Wrangel and Denikin have met for the Last time, and it seems as though their plans for a seizure of Power are to be swift and sudden. They plan to storm the Winter Palace and take the Tsar hostage, in order to ensure their own rise to power. Only time will tell if the Tsar can weather the Storm"
aiu_rus.10.a:0 "God be with Tsar Nick!"
aiu_rus.11.t:0 "Military Storms the Winter Palace!"
aiu_rus.11.d:0 "Dire news from Petrograd, as the Military has taken control of the Winter Palace!\n In what was cited as a quick and sudden seizure of power, The 1st Guards Division under the command of Baron Pyotr Wrangel stormed the Winter Palace int he early hours of the morning. After a quick skirmish with the Tsar's bodyguards, the Tsar's family were placed under house arrest, with the Tsar and his son managing to escape the Coup by sneaking out the Palace and escaping onboard a destroyer. They are said to have fled to England. The Baron and the General have declared a Military Regency, promising to elect a true Romanov Tsar once the civil war has Concluded"

aiu_rus.12.d:0 "In what was described as a true Military Disaster, the attacking 1st Guards Division was repelled by the Tsar's personal guard in the early hours of the Morning. Even though the plan was said to impeccable, the Tsar was tipped off by a loyalist in the Division of the planned coup. When the Guards Division tried to storm the Palace they surprised to find barricades and machine guns placed protecting the Palace from intruders. A bloody melee ensued, with the Guards Division being routed after a succesfull flank attack by the Tsar's Cossack Regiment, led by General Annekov. Following the collosal failure, Baron Wrangel has fled the country whilst General Denkin was found in his headquarters, having shot himself. The Tsar has declared a State of Emergency until the situation has been fully resolved"
aiu_rus.12.a:0 "The Tsar cannot be Overthrown!"
aiu_rus.13.t:0 "The Tsar Accepts!"
aiu_rus.13.d:0 "In a truly unexpected turn of Events, the Tsar has accepted for the General to be released. This seems to have been a surprise to the Generals as well, as they seem to have expect the Tsar to act rashly. The Tsar declared his discomfort in doing this, but in an official speech stated that he would rather see the captive General to be released than see the Military act in a hostile way."
aiu_rus.13.a:0 "Good Speech to be Honest"
aiu_rus.14.t:0 "Military Plans Coup."
aiu_rus.14.d:0 "It seems that Denikin and Wrangel were not satisfied with the Tsar's decision. They have met for the last time, planning to storm the Winter Palace and take the Tsar Hostage. This however might prove more difficult than they anticipated, with a large portion of their close Staff announcing their loyalty to the Tsar, seeing how well he handled the situation of the rouge General."

aiu_rus.15.t:0 "General sent to the Far East"
aiu_rus.15.d:0 "After the unfortunate events of last Week, the Rouge General has been sent away to command a Penal Battalion in the Far East, near the Vladivostok Front. Whilst angering a large portion of the civilian population, this has most definetely calmed the Military, who seem more than content with the Tsar's Decision."

aiu_rus.16.t:0 "Military draws up Ultimatum"
aiu_rus.16.d:0 "Earlier today, Wrangel and Denikin have met to draw up an Ultimatum to the Tsar. Unhappy due to the fact that the Tsar did not only handle the protests properly but due to his takeover of the Military, the Duo plan to Install the Tsar's more lenient son as the New Tsar, forcing the Tsar to stand down.The question however remains - What will the Tsar's Reaction be?"
aiu_rus.16.a:0 "Let us Pray for a smart Decision"
aiu_rus.17.t:0 "The Tsar Recieves the Ultimatum"
aiu_rus.17.d:0 "The Ultimatum was handed to Tsar shortly before the the Winter Palace was encircled by the 1st Guards Division, commanded by General Wrangel in Person. The Tsar was seen clearly distressed by this, but he kept himself composed as he adressed the Public. He stated that he needs time to think over this, and has secluded himself within the Winter Palace."

He adressed the people stating that even when he will no longer be in power he will stand vigilant over the Nation, keeping watch over it from the Dangers of the Federals and Communists.

aiu_rus.19.d:0 "In a Fervent speech adressed to the Whole nation, the Tsar Nikolai has declared that the Power given to him has been given to him by God, and only he can take that power from him. He declared that he will not allow the military to meddle in these affairs, and has declared that he will even die if that is what must be done. After this speech was delivered, some of the 1st Guards Division was seen deserting to the Winter Palace, but the Tsar is still outnumbered. Baron Wrangel was seen organising his men into a Frontal Assault on the Palace"

The Tsar himself was seen leading the defence from the Front, with his Bodyguards right by his Side. The Tsar and his men managed to hold out the Initial Assault, brining down many of the attackers. After a second assault was carried out, this time with doubled feriocity, the Tsar and his men were finally beaten back further into the Palace, with the Guards taking control of most of the Palace. When offered an honourable surrender, the Tsar answered by sending away the dignitary with a Bullet right through his hat. The Tsar and his men were finally killed by an assault led by the most Veteran of the 1st Guards. The Tsar was seen trying to be apprehend, fighting back with a sabre in his Hand.

aiu_rus.21.d:0 "Citing the Death of the Tsar as a necessary evil, the Military has taken control of the country, declaring a Military Regency. Seeing the young Alexei as too much of a threat, they have placed Alexei under house arrest. They declared that the current situation in the country is too unstable for the Young Alexei to take power and have declared that they will allow for a Tsar to ascend once the Civil war is over"

He declared that he feels as though his father, whilst a brilliant man, was in the wrong when he attempted to seize close to Dictatorial Power during the Chaos that the Country has endured. He also declared that he will rule more leniently than his father, promising to revive the Democratic Elements of the nation."

aiu_rus.26.d:0 "Following the events of the last few days, the Tsar has seen a large decrease in popularity, with many of the Citizens seeing the Tsar as weak, bowing to the demands of the few, rather than to the Wishes of the Many.

After the Russo-Japanese war of 1905, we took Port Arthur from the Russian Empire, damaging their trade in the Orient substanitally. Now, due to our newfound friendship, the Russians are proposing that we make an exchange - we will give the Port of Dalian and some of the Surrounding lands, in return for North Sakhalin. What will our response be?"

After an initial assault was repelled by the local artillery and a Bombardment from the Imperial Battleship, Gagnut, the advancing Red Army forces bided their time, waiting for the next colums of troops to reach the City. The city was shelled heavily by the Red Army artillery, which managed to creates many holes in the barricades set up outside the City. After an initial assault by the Red Guards took the first line of Trenches, the Imperial Forces were forced back to the City, where the battle devolved into a fierce Melee in the Streets, ending with The Cavalry managing to break many of the Defending forces, with the Remnants of the Imperial Army escaping either through sea or into the Surrounding Countryside.
